# Movie Search Application (Backend)

This is the backend for the Movie Search Application, built using **Node.js** and **ExpressJS**. It serves as the API layer that communicates with a **Python** service for performing movie searches using AI models such as Sentence Transformers.

## Features

- **Movie Search API**: Accepts plot descriptions from the frontend and returns the most relevant movie matches.
- **Communication with Python AI Service**: Uses Axios to send search queries to the Python service, which processes the request using a pre-trained AI model.
- **Error Handling**: Handles all potential errors, such as API failures, and provides meaningful responses to the client.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **ExpressJS**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the Python AI service.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OldAlexhub/moviesnjs.git
